# GvlRestaurants

Welcome to the Greenville Restaurants GEM. This Ruby Gem provides a CLI to view the 10 best restaurants in Greenville, SC according to USA Today. The CLI will give you options of what locations in Greenville the user would like, and after making that selection it will provide further information so the user can select a restaurant. Once a restaurant is chosen, the restaurant's information can be provided to facilitate the customer to either view their menu or call the restaurant to make a reservation.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gvl_restaurants'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
